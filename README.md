# AdventOfCode2022
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) 0.10.0

There is a program for each day in `src/`, input data for each day is located in `src/data/`

```shell
# Build and run a particular day
zig build run-day06

# Build and run any tests for a particular day
zig build test-day06
```
